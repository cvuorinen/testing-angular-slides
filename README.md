# Testing Angular Apps Slides

Slides for my _Testing Angular apps_ talk

Slides are designed for [patat](https://github.com/jaspervdj/patat), but can also be viewed in GitHub (as they are just MarkDown) [slides.md](slides.md)

Example code can be found inside the angular-excel directory, branches step1, step2 etc. evolve the code along the presentation. You can skip to the last one to see all code.
